            <h2>Ethical, Legal, and Social Implications (ELSI)</h2>

            <h3 class="sub">The Position of ELSI in This Study</h3>
            <h3>
            ELSI stands for Ethical, Legal, and Social Issues, which refers to key considerations that must be addressed when developing and applying new scientific and technological innovations in society. In this project, as we develop hydrogels made from DNA materials, we place strong emphasis on safety and responsible research practices from ethical, legal, and social perspectives.
            </h3>
            <br>

            <h3 class="sub">Ethical Issue</h3>
            <h3>
            In the course of this study, we have emphasized accuracy and transparency in experimental data, ensuring reproducibility and responsible research practices by thoroughly recording and sharing all experimental procedures. Although we evaluated the formation and degradation behavior of DNA hydrogels, we did not conduct any experiments involving bacterial capture using aptamers or direct contact with biological samples.
            <br><br>
            In the future, we plan to perform experiments using actual bacteria. At that stage, potential risks such as unintended bacterial leakage may arise. To address these concerns, we will ensure biosafety by strictly adhering to laboratory safety regulations, implementing rigorous handling protocols, and maintaining regular safety checks and information sharing among researchers. Through these measures, we aim to conduct all future experiments in a safe and ethically responsible manner.
            </h3>
            <br>

            <h3 class="sub">Legal Issue</h3>
            <h3> 
            The DNA used in this study consists solely of artificially synthesized non-coding sequences obtained from external companies (Eurofins Genomics and Hokkaido System Science Co., Ltd.). These sequences do not contain any biologically derived genetic information. The DNA was utilized not as a “genetic information-bearing substance,” but rather as a “designable and safe material.” No genetic modification or introduction into living organisms was performed, and thus the risk of direct impact on organisms or ecosystems is minimal.<br>
            Therefore, this study is not subject to the following laws and regulations:
            </h3>
            <ul style="font-size:1.15em; line-height:1.4;">
                <li>Act on the Regulation of the Use of Living Modified Organisms (Cartagena Act)</li>
                <li>Act on the Prevention of Infectious Diseases and Medical Care for Patients with Infectious Diseases (Infectious Diseases Control Law)</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>
            If, in the future, biological samples containing genetic material are handled, appropriate applications and management will be conducted in accordance with these laws and the guidelines of the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT).
            </h3>
            <br>

            <h3 class="sub">Social Issue</h3>
            <h3>
            The technology of using DNA as a material can sometimes be misunderstood by the general public as “genetic modification” or “manipulation of living organisms.” In our research, the goal is not to manipulate the genetic information of organisms, but to safely use DNA as a structural material. To ensure this point is correctly understood, we make efforts to communicate our research in a way that is easy to understand not only for experts but also for the general public.
            <br><br>
            Through explanations using figures and animations, we aim to widely convey the safety and usefulness of DNA material technology. At the same time, there may be concerns about potential effects on the human body from substances created using DNA as a material. Regarding this point, we plan to demonstrate safety in the future through non-clinical studies using mice. In conducting these experiments, we will strictly adhere to ethical guidelines for animal experimentation and strive to gain social understanding.
            </h3>
            <br>

            <h3 class="sub">Conclusion</h3>
            <h3>
            The DNA hydrogel developed in this study is scientifically sound, legally compliant, and conducted with social responsibility in mind. All DNA used consists of artificially synthesized non-coding sequences, and there is no risk of genetic modification or infection.
            <br><br>
            We believe that for science and technology to be accepted by society and to develop sustainably, researchers themselves must engage in dialogue with society and conduct ethical and responsible research. Moving forward, we will continue research activities with full consideration of ELSI, while keeping in mind potential applications in medicine and the environment, contributing to a future in which science and society develop in harmony.
