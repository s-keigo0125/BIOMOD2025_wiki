        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <h3>
        In this study, we focused on testing whether the entropy-driven circuit could function in combination with a DNA hydrogel. Specifically, we did not integrate the aptamer-based bacterial recognition module; instead, we directly added the output DNA produced by the circuit to the hydrogel solution to experimentally determine whether it could induce hydrogel dissolution.

        We compared four samples with different catalyst concentrations. The catalyst concentrations were adjusted to 50 nM (Sample #1), 25 nM (Sample #2), 10 nM (Sample #3), and 0 nM (Sample #4). Each solution also contained 20 nM of Substrate and 1000 nM of Fuel.<br>
        To detect the presence of the Output, we used a reporter molecule as illustrated below. When the output strand is present, it binds to the reporter and triggers a strand displacement reaction. The reporter consists of a duplex of a fluorophore-labeled DNA strand and a BHQ-labeled quencher strand. Initially, fluorescence is quenched by the BHQ; however, when the strand displacement reaction occurs, the fluorophore-labeled strand is released, resulting in an increase in fluorescence intensity. The change in fluorescence intensity was monitored using real-time PCR (model number: CFX Opus 96), with measurements taken every minute for 80 minutes at a constant temperature of 25 °C.

        The rate of increase in fluorescence intensity for the 50 nM sample slowed significantly after 10 minutes.On the other hand, under other conditions, the fluorescence intensity gradually increased throughout the measurement time. The result showed that amplification occurred more in the 0 nM condition than in the 10 nM condition. 
        However, focusing on the change over time, it can be seen that the fluorescence intensity increase in the 0 nM condition occurred at nearly the same time point as the 50 nM and 25 nM conditions, and the subsequent rate of increase was not significantly different from the 10 nM condition.
        Therefore, it's possible the 0 nM and 10 nM samples were switched, but this isn't certain.<br>
        Nonetheless, the overall trend confirmed that a higher catalyst concentration led to a faster Output generation rate and a higher final Output concentration. Thus, we concluded that the literature results were generally reproducible and decided to proceed to the next experiment."

        Since the output sequence is included within the substrate, the maximum possible output concentration in this experiment is equal to the substrate concentration, i.e., 300 nM. 
        The fluorescence intensity increased as the catalyst concentration rose from 0 to 25 nM, but decreased at higher concentrations. Focusing on the sample with a catalyst concentration of 25 nM, which exhibited the strongest fluorescence signal, the fluorescence intensity corresponded to an output concentration between 200 nM and 300 nM.<br>
        In addition, the fluorescence intensity increased rapidly up to approximately 60 minutes and continued to rise gradually thereafter. A noise spike was observed around 85 minutes, which was likely due to an instrument error; since no change in the data trend was observed after the noise event, the measurement itself was considered reliable.
        From these results, it was confirmed that the entropy-driven circuit achieved an amplification rate of approximately tenfold.

        In this electrophoretic analysis, we investigated which combinations of four DNA strands (designated as strand 1, 2, 3, and 4) would form duplexes or higher-order structures. For this purpose, a total of 16 sample solutions, representing all possible combinations, were prepared as shown in the results (Fig. 3a). A 20 bp DNA Ladder was used as a size reference. In each solution, the concentration of each DNA strand was 200 nM, and the sodium ion (Na⁺) concentration was 50 mM.

        A 10% polyacrylamide gel, polymerized with 0.1% TEMED and 0.1% APS, was prepared. The sample solutions were loaded into the wells of the gel, and electrophoresis was conducted at a constant voltage of 100 V for 1 hour.

        As illustrated in Fig.4b, in the solution containing all four strands (Strand 1, 2, 3, and 4), a band was observed at a position with significantly lower electrophoretic mobility than the largest fragment (300 bp) of the 20 bp DNA Ladder used for reference. This suggests that a higher-order assembly, composed of multiple motifs, was formed.
        Furthermore, in the solutions containing two different strands, the combinations of non-complementary pairs (1 and 3; 2 and 4) exhibited bands at the same positions as their single-strand counterparts. In contrast, the combinations with complementary sequences produced an additional band at a higher position (i.e., lower mobility) than the single-strand bands. These results confirm that the designed DNA sequences hybridized as intended.
        <br><br>
        However, the fluorescent band from the four-strand mixture was concentrated near the loading wells at the top of the gel, indicating that its size exceeded the separation limit of polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). This implies that the molecular weight of the formed assembly was beyond the resolution range of the PAGE system.

        The DLS measurements were performed on a Zetasizer Ultra Red Label (model number: ZSU3305, Malvern Panalytical) at a constant temperature of 25°C. The measurement duration was set to "auto" for each analysis.

        As illustrated in the graph, a peak was observed in the range of 1000 nm to 10000 nm. In Group A, which used NaCl salt, no significant changes were observed in the peak intensity on the micrometer scale, even when the concentration was varied. In contrast, in Group B, which used MgCl₂ salt, it was confirmed that the peak intensity on the micrometer scale decreased as the salt concentration increased. Overall, changing the metal ion did not produce any significant differences in the characteristic peak positions or the overall trends.
        <br><br>
        From these results, it is presumed that structures on the order of several to tens of micrometers are being formed. Based on this outcome, we have decided to use MgCl₂ as the buffer salt at a concentration of 12.5 mM for this project. This decision is based on the fact that no significant differences in peak position or intensity were observed in the low concentration range, and that 12.5 mM corresponds to the optimal operating conditions for the entropy-driven circuit.

        As indicated by the data, in the low concentration range of 40 µM and below, peaks in the micrometer (µm) range were either not observed or exhibited low intensity. This suggests that structures on the micrometer scale do not form when the DNA concentration is low.
        Therefore, it is considered that a concentration of several hundred micromolars is likely necessary for the sequences designed in this project. However, despite the high concentrations used, the size of the resulting structures is relatively small, indicating that sufficient formation of higher-order structures commensurate with the concentration has not been achieved.

        <h2>Experiment 7 : Assessment of Sticky-Ends Dissociation using DLS</h2>
        <h3 class="sub">Objective</h3>
        <h3>
        To determine whether the output from the entropy-driven circuit can disrupt the bonds between the sticky ends of the hydrogel motifs.    
        </h3>
        <h3 class="sub">Method</h3>
        <h3>
        We prepared a total of six samples in two series, as detailed in Table 7a. The first series (Sample #A) consisted of samples that were annealed on the day of the experiment, while the second series comprised samples that had been annealed two days prior. The standard annealing protocol involved heating the samples to 95°C for 5 minutes, followed by cooling to 4°C at a rate of -1°C per minute.
        In this experiment, Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) measurements were conducted in two stages to compare the size of the initial structures, formed by the motif sequences alone, with their size after the addition of subsequent DNA strands.
        <br><br>
        First, a 16 µL "base solution" was prepared, consisting of the four gel motif sequences (80 µM each) in a buffer solution containing 12.5 mM MgCl₂, 10 mM Tris, and 1.0 mM EDTA. This base solution was annealed, and its initial molecular size distribution was measured by DLS.
        <br><br>
        Following the initial measurement, 4 µL of a solution containing either an "output" strand or a "fuel" strand was added to the 16 µL base solution, bringing the total volume to 20 µL. This dilution resulted in final concentrations of 64 µM for each gel motif sequence and 9.2 µM for the added DNA strand. The buffer concentrations remained constant throughout the experiment. The particle size distribution of this final solution was then measured again by DLS.
        For Sample #B3, a time-course analysis was performed to monitor changes after the addition of the output strand. DLS measurements were taken at three time points: immediately after addition (0 min), at 10 minutes, and at 20 minutes, to track the temporal evolution of the particle size distribution.
        <br><br>
        DLS measurements were conducted using the Malvern Panalytical Zetasizer Ultra Red Label, with a measurement temperature of 25°C and an auto setting for the measurement duration.

        A horizontal comparison of the resulting graphs revealed no significant differences among the samples to which the "Output" strand, "Fuel" strand, or buffer alone was added. 
        Furthermore, a vertical comparison of the graphs showed no significant variations attributable to the timing of the annealing process. In the time-course analysis of Sample #B3, no remarkable changes in the particle size distribution were observed from immediately after the addition of the "Output" strand up to 20 minutes later.
        <br><br>
        These results indicate that no significant decrease in particle size, as measured by DLS, was observed even after the addition of the "Output" strand, which was expected to disrupt the bonds between the gel motifs. One possible explanation is that the binding between the sticky ends was more stable than anticipated, thus preventing the strand displacement reaction from proceeding sufficiently. Alternatively, even if partial dissociation did occur, the change in overall particle size may have been too small to be detected by DLS, as the sticky end portions constitute a minor fraction of the entire hydrogel motif.

        <h3 class="sub">Objective</h3>
        <h3>
        The primary objective is to evaluate the relative size of the DNA assemblies, which previously exceeded the separation limit of PAGE, by using agarose gel electrophoresis, a method suitable for a broader molecular weight range. A secondary objective is to determine if the addition of the "output" strand from the entropy-driven circuit induces the dissociation of the bonds between the sticky ends, resulting in a measurable decrease in assembly size.
        </h3>

        <h3 class="sub">Method</h3>
        <h3>
        In this experiment, we prepared a total of 13 samples, which were divided into two series: Sample #A and Sample #B. The Sample #A series consisted of four samples with a varying number of DNA motif sequence types. For each sample, the specified DNA motifs were prepared at a concentration of 250 nM each in a buffer solution (12.5 mM MgCl₂, 10 mM Tris, 1.0 mM EDTA). The total volume of each sample was 2.5 µL. The compositions were as follows:
        </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>#A1: 1 motif type (Strand 3)</li>
            <li>#A2: 2 motif types (Strand 2, 3)</li>
            <li>#A3: 3 motif types (Strand 1, 2, 3)</li>
            <li>#A4: 4 motif types (Strand 1, 2, 3, 4)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>
        The Sample #B series comprised nine samples, which were prepared by adding a solution containing either an "output" strand (500 nM), a "fuel" strand (500 nM), or buffer alone to a base solution containing all four motif sequences (500 nM each). The motif solution and the added solution were mixed at different volume ratios (2:1, 1:1, and 1:2) to a final volume of 2.5 µL for each sample (details in Table 8a). The buffer concentration was maintained constant across all samples.

        <br><br>
        <h3>
        All prepared samples were subjected to an annealing process: heating to 95°C for 5 minutes, followed by cooling to 4°C at a rate of -1°C per minute. Samples to which the "output" or "fuel" strands were added were subsequently incubated at room temperature for 30 minutes. Following this, 0.5 µL of loading buffer was added to each sample, bringing the final volume to 3.0 µL.
        <br><br>
        The samples were then loaded onto a 3% agarose gel. Electrophoresis was performed at a constant voltage of 100 V for 30 minutes. To maintain the structural integrity of the DNA assemblies, the electrophoresis was conducted inside a 4°C refrigerator. A 20 bp DNA Ladder was used as a size reference. After the electrophoretic run, the gel was observed with a fluorescence imager to analyze the band patterns.

        When comparing samples prepared with the same component ratios, the bands corresponding to the samples with the "output" strand were observed to be fainter. Furthermore, a comparison among the "output" strand samples themselves revealed that the bands became progressively fainter as the concentration of the "output" strand increased. These results suggest that the addition of the "output" strand may inhibit the formation of DNA assemblies.
        <br><br>
        However, a limitation of this experimental design is that varying the volume ratios resulted in simultaneous changes to the concentrations of both the motif sequences and the "output" strand. Consequently, it was not possible to definitively distinguish whether the observed decrease in band intensity was due to a lower overall DNA concentration or to the dissociation of the assemblies induced by the "output" strand.

        Upon visual inspection of Fig. 9a, the band for sample B1, to which the "Output" strand was added at a concentration of 1000 µM, appeared fainter than the other samples. However, to account for the possibility of an optical illusion, three representative samples (B1, B4, and B7) were selected for a quantitative comparison of their band intensities (Fig. 9b).
        The quantitative analysis revealed no significant difference in intensity among these three samples, failing to substantiate the initial visual impression from Fig. 9a. Therefore, under the current experimental conditions, the inhibitory effect of the "Output" strand on assembly formation remains inconclusive.

The objective is to determine which of the following processes is thermodynamically favored: the binding between the sticky ends or the formation of a complementary duplex between a motif and the "Output" strand. This will serve to verify the correctness of the sticky end sequence design and to confirm that the synthesized DNA strands are free of errors.
        The possibility of an issue with the "Output" strand sequence itself can be excluded, as it was previously shown in Experiment 2 to react correctly with its reporter strand to produce a fluorescent signal. Therefore, this next phase of verification will focus specifically on the validity of the sticky end sequence design. (<a href="#Experiment12">Experiment 12</a>)

        <h2>Experiment 12 :Output-Induced Displacement Analysis by PAGE(3rd)</h2>
        <h3 class="sub">Objective</h3>
        <h3>
        To verify the correctness of the "Output" strand's sequence design and confirm that the synthesized strand is free of errors. This will be achieved by modifying the previous experimental conditions to perform annealing immediately after mixing the DNA solution and adding the "Output" strand.
        </h3>
        <h3 class="sub">Method</h3> 
        <h3>
        In this experiment, a total of 14 different samples were prepared at a volume of 5.0 µL each, as depicted in the results (Fig. 12a). For each sample, strand 1, strand 2, strand 3, strand 4, the "output" strand, and the "fuel" strand were added as required and mixed in a buffer containing 12.5 mM MgCl₂, 10 mM Tris, and 1.0 mM EDTA. The final concentration was adjusted to 0.25 µM for each of the motif DNA strands and the "output" strand, and to 0.5 µM for the "fuel" strand.
        <br><br>
        The preparation procedure was as follows: The required motif DNA strands (strands 1-4) were mixed in the buffer, and subsequently, the corresponding "output" or "fuel" strand was added. The entire mixture was then subjected to an annealing process, which involved heating to 95°C for 5 minutes, followed by cooling to 4°C at a rate of -1°C per minute.
        <br><br>
        After annealing, 1.0 µL of loading buffer was added to and mixed with each sample. A 10% polyacrylamide gel (polymerized with 0.1% TEMED and 0.1% APS) was prepared, and the samples were loaded onto the gel. Electrophoresis was conducted at a constant voltage of 100 V for 50 minutes. Following the run, the gel was stained with SYBR Gold, and the mobility of the bands was observed under UV illumination.

        A comparison of the bands in lane 5 versus 9, and lane 6 versus 10, revealed no visible changes in either their position or intensity. The results show that even after the annealing process, the band indicating the binding of the motif DNA is still observed, while no new band corresponding to the binding of the "Output" strand to a motif DNA strand was detected. This suggests that the intended reaction did not proceed, even under conditions that were designed to favor the formation of a complementary duplex with the "Output" strand.
        <br><br>
        A possible explanation for this outcome is that the observed binding between the DNA motifs is not due to the intended sticky-end interactions (14 bases), but rather to the formation of a more stable duplex between the much longer arm regions (34 bases). Thermodynamically, the arm-to-arm binding would be more stable due to its greater length. If the motifs are binding via their arm regions, the sticky ends would not be involved in the primary interaction. Consequently, the sticky-end bond targeted for displacement by the "Output" strand might not exist in the first place.
        </h3>
        <h3 class="sub">Next Step</h3>
        <h3>
        In the next experiment, we will use DNA strands that consist solely of the sticky end sequence, with no arm regions. The purpose is to verify whether the intended binding and displacement reaction with the "output" strand can occur. This will allow for an independent evaluation of the functionality of the sticky end sequence itself and the viability of the strand displacement reaction, isolating it from the potential interference of the arm regions.

        <h2>Experiment 13 : Output-Induced Displacement Analysis by PAGE(4th)</h2>
        <h3 class="sub">Objective</h3>
        <h3>
        Building on the results of the previous experiment, the objective is to verify whether the "Output" strand can bind to its target by using a DNA strand that consists solely of the sticky end sequence.
        </h3>
        <h3 class="sub">Method</h3>
        <h3>
        In this experiment, a total of 11 different samples were prepared at a volume of 5.0 µL each, as depicted in the results (Fig. 13a). For each sample, "short sticky end" strands, "long sticky end" strands, the "output" strand, and the "fuel" strand were added as required and mixed in a buffer containing 12.5 mM MgCl₂, 10 mM Tris, and 1.0 mM EDTA. The final concentration for each of the sticky end strands, as well as for the "output" and "fuel" strands, was adjusted to 0.25 µM. The detailed preparation procedure was identical to that described in Experiments 10-12.
        <br><br>
        A 10% polyacrylamide gel (polymerized with 0.1% TEMED and 0.1% APS) was prepared, and the samples were loaded onto the gel. Electrophoresis was conducted at a constant voltage of 100 V for 50 minutes. Following the run, the gel was stained with SYBR Gold, and the mobility of the bands was observed under UV illumination.

        <h3>
        Within the lanes containing the "Output" strand, no band was observed at a higher position than the "Output" strand alone (Lane 3), which would have indicated a complex formed between the "Output" strand and a sticky end strand. This suggests that no complementary binding occurred between them. Furthermore, in lane 5, where two complementary sticky end strands were mixed, no band indicating the formation of a dimer was observed.
        <br><br>
        This pair of results indicates that the binding affinity of the sticky end sequences is thermodynamically unstable under the reaction conditions at room temperature. This finding also provides further support for the hypothesis that the binding observed between the full DNA motifs in Experiments 10-12 was due to duplex formation between their long arm regions, not the intended sticky-end interactions.
        </h3>
        <h3 class="sub">Next Step</h3>
        <h3>
        Based on the results of the current experiment, the next step is to verify whether binding between the sticky end strands can be induced by conducting the reaction under cooled conditions, rather than at room temperature. (<a href="#experiment14">Experiment 14</a>)
